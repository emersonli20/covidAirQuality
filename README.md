<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>NO<sub>2</sub> levels across the United State have decreased after March 2020 due to COVID-19</li>
    <li>The NO<sub>2</sub> levels correlated with the seversity of COVID-19 in different states.</li>
    <li>The amount of change is greatest in states that are more liberal</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Why NO<sub>2</sub>? And why a decrease?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NO<sub>2</sub> is released into the atmosphere due to burning fuel</li>
      <li>Main sources
        <ul>
          <li>Car Emissions</li>
          <li>Trucks and Buses</li>
          <li>Power Plants</li>
          <li>Off-road equipmemnt</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>COVID-19's effect on transit
        <ul>
          <li>Mass quarantining => more people off the roads</li>
          <li>Remote jobs => a general decrease in vehicular usage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>
    In theory, the decreased transit should cause a decrease in NO2 levels and a greater drop in the Air Quality Index across the US.
    </b>
  
  <h3>NO<sub>2</sub> Levels & Partisanship</h3>
  <b>
  Conservative states have had looser COVID-19 restrictions compared to liberal states
  </b>
  <ul>
    <li>Looser mask/vaccine/social-distancing mandates in these states</li>
  </ul>
  <b>
  We expect that liberal states will have lower COVID positivity rates and a larger decrease in NO<sub>2</sub> levels
